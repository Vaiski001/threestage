# Configuration Files ⚙️

This directory contains configuration files for the Enquiry Management App.

## Files

- 📄 `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- 📄 `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- 📄 `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
- 📄 `eslint.config.js` - ESLint configuration

## Usage

These files are duplicated from the root directory for reference. Please note that the application may still use the configuration files in the root directory, as that is the standard location for these files.

When making changes to configuration:

1. Modify the files in the root directory first
2. Then duplicate the changes to the files in this directory for reference

## Purpose

This directory serves as a centralized place to keep track of configuration settings, making it easier to understand and modify the application's configuration.

## Notes

- Some configuration files remain in the root directory as they need to be in their standard locations to be recognized by their respective tools.
- The duplication is for organizational purposes only.
