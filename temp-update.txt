Completed implementation of admin dashboard with enhanced features. Added three new admin pages:

1. Notification Management - for managing notification templates and delivery channels with real-time updates
2. Audit Logs - for tracking system activities with filtering and CSV export
3. API Management - for creating and managing API keys and integrations

All pages include real-time data synchronization through Supabase, comprehensive error handling, and responsive UI using ShadCN components and Tailwind CSS. Updated the AdminLayout sidebar navigation to include these new sections and added quick access cards to the dashboard.
